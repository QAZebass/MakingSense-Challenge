## About the challenge
A person wants to go to buy a car on www.mercadolibre.com. He is not sure about what model to buy and, for this reason, he wants to search for all the cars that have a price below
$2.000.000. But he has some considerations to take into account: The car must be located in Cordoba, and the product list must be shown from lowest to highest price. In addition, he wants to
know the number of results available.
